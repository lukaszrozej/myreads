# MyReads

## Description

This is a project for Udacity Front End Nanodegree.
It allows the user searching through a collection of books
and placing them on shelves (Currently Reading, Want To Read, Read).

It is based on a [starter code from Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter)
and uses backend server provided by Udacity.
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.

```
git clone git@github.com:lukaszrozej/myreads.git
